# Open Pi0

This project aims to reproduce [Pi0](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0), a general-purpose robot foundation model developed by [Physical Intelligence](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/). We are committed to bringing this cutting-edge technology to a wider community of researchers and developers, and we encourage collaboration in optimizing and improving the model. Embracing the open-source spirit, we welcome contributions through Pull Requests (PRs) from the community. We believe that it is through collective effort in the open-source ecosystem that we can push the boundaries of robotic technology and ultimately build a state-of-the-art Robot Foundation Model. Join us in this endeavor, and together we can advance the field and create smarter, more efficient robotic systems.
